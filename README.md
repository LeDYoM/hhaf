# Host Application Framework (HAF)  {#mainpaige}

## A C++ (game) application framework

This repository contains a framework to develop graphical and application
interactive applications. It is not the first one, that is known but it is
mainly a source of learning. So I try to accomplish some objectives:
* Use mondern C++
* Use modern design techniques
* Accomplish big modularity
* Use CMake in a modern and consistent way

The framework is divided in different main modules. You do not need to know
about all of them to use the framework.

## Modules
Here are the modules you can view the documentation from:
> [htypes module](@ref htypes_lib)

> [haf module](@ref haf_main_lib)
